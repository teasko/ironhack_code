# Data Visualization Project

For this data visualization project, I used data on powerplants througout the world in combination with basic aggregated data on almost all countries of the world.

First, both data sets were cleaned and merged together in a Jupyter Notebook. Then, the combined data was imported into Tableau to create Tableau-Story with five story points. The story was published on the Tableau public server:
