​
## Analyzing air traffic data of the European Union - data based on Eurostat
​
​
In this repository you will find the following folders:
​
​
### DATA
Contains CSV files with the information extracted from the sources
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database
https://openflights.org/data.html
​
​
### NOTEBOOKS
Contains several notebooks used for this project. Can be distinguished 2 main types:
​
- get & plot notebooks aimed to process information necessary to the analysis
- eda notebooks are exploratory analysis, separated in 3 dimensions: Europe, Germany and Berlin
​
​
### PLOT_AND_GRAPHS
Selection of graphs which will be part of the presentation in .png format
​
​
### PRESENTATION
Contains presentation in .pdf format, being only a fraction of all the information gathered in the notebooks, is what we considered the most significant information that will fit in 5-minutes presentation
​
The presentation can be also found in Google Slides

​
​
​
​
#### Initial approach to the project
​
We wanted to exercise with time series and with maps and considered that flights data fit perfectly in both aspects.
The huge amount of information suggest to split in part to be easier to handle. We decided to split in 3 parts:
​
- Europe level
- Country level (Germany)
- City level (Berlin)
​
And list the potential graphs/information we will explore
​
##### Europe
​
- Evalution of amount of routes (count), volume of flights, passengers and/or seats along time
- Evolution of occupation (passengers/seats) along time
- Top countries in metrics
​
##### Country
- Evalution of amount of routes (count), volume of flights, passengers and/or seats along time (2008 crisis)
- busiest airports
- popular destinations (from Germany somewhere else)
- seasonality of connections (count) and distances
- distribution of distances (histogram) (per year)
- Comparative growth Domestic vs EU vs Overseas
- distance vs occupation (scatter plot )
- inspect events changing dinamic (flights to north Africa after any attack, virus crisis, October fest,Köln carnival...) 
​
##### City
- connection with other cities (Paris & London)
- competition among airports (Tegel vs Schonefeld)
- seasonality of connections (count) and distances
​
​
The result is what can be found in the folders, with focus on presenting the results on Feb 17th 2020.# eu_airtraffic
